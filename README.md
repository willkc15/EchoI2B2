ECHO I2B2 - Wake Forest Baptist Intern Project
	
The goal of this project is to create an Alexa skill which will allow users to query I2B2 through simple voice interactions with an Amazon echo device.

IMPLEMENTATION
	
Used the Alexa Skills Kit(ASK) SDK available through Amazon's developer console to create a list of voice commands that Alexa will "wake up" to and answer user questions. The developer console transforms the intents and utterances the developer creates into JSON to send to the service endpoint. I've chosen the endpoint to be hosted as an AWS Lambda function, which handles much of the server management and is free up to 1 million requests per month. This lambda function takes the users query which we gather from the JSON sent to Lambda and stores it in a mySQL db. The Lambda function also handles user authentication. I then wrote python code on my personal machine connected to the Wake network which checks the db every 5 seconds and pulls a query if it is new. The code then sends a series of XML requests to an I2B2 endpoint which ultimately returns the result we are looking for. The result is then stored in the db. An automatic email is also sent to the user with the result. 
 

MOVING FORWARD

Prototype is complete but could still use many improvements:
- Better user authentication. Right now we are just storing a password and email in db. I'm also using the deviceID of the Alexa device as a unique identifier for each user which could cause problems for multiple users on a single device.
- Individual search keys we gather from I2B2 are currently assigned a random totalNum value as this prototype does not access the real I2B2 data. We then use Levenshteins algorithm as a tiebreak. This is good behavior but the totalNum value will need to be gathered from I2B2 instead of assigned a random value to make it function correctly.
- Eventually, when Amazon develops the capabilities, it would be great to send the result back to Alexa and have her speak it out to the user. 

WIKI

- Alexa Developer Console: Pretty intuitive, good user interface. Hard code intents and utterances or just copy the package.json I have in the Alexa Developer Console directory
- AWS Lambda: Most difficult to configure. You first want to create a Lambda function. Choose the blueprint 'alexa-skill-kit-sdk-factskill' as it will already have some of the necessary triggers to run the Lambda function. Once this is created, just delete all the template code. You then want to upload a deployment package as a zip file to Lambda. You can take the index.js and package.json files I have here and put it in your own i2b2_lamda project folder. You'll also want to install all the necessary packages into this directory as you can't install them on Lambda. Then just zip the individual files (NOT THE ENTIRE PROJECT DIRECTORY) and upload to Lambda. Once code is uploaded to Lambda, you'll have to set the appropriate execution roles. Go to AWS IAM, which is basically the security management for AWS and click on 'Roles'. From here you'll want to create a new role which contains the two policies: 'AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole' and 'AmazonRDSFullAccess'. That is, if you choose to use an RDS mySQL db instance. Once this execution role is defined, you'll have to set it as the execution role you would like to use with the Lambda function. Just scroll down in Lambda till you see 'EXECUTION ROLE'
- Python internal code: Just have it running on the wake network and everything should work!

Note: A lot of code focuses on the RDS mySQL db which I have had to delete so I am not charged. No code outside the config.json file would have to be changed as long as any mySQL db is still used. For recreating db: I had two tables, 'querys' and 'userInfo'. querys had columns: 'query' (actual user query string), 'queryID' (primary key), 'userID', 'result'. userInfo, the authentication table, had columns: 'userID', 'password', 'email', and 'device' (unique alexa device identifier). Although userID and device are both unique keys, device is used to initially check if the user already exists while userID functions as a foreign key to connect the two tables.
